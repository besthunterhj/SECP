To me, Thai food has never been and will never be mind-blowing.

The food was very good, although I would have preferred if the pork belly I ordered had been roasted a bit longer for a more melt-in-your-mouth experience.
Food was very good as well, considering that we tried the budget selection (though I wish the pork belly that I ordered was roasted a bit longer, so that the fat could have been more rendered and tastier).
Both times I've been to Sapphire, the food has been consistently decent, if not great.

Most of the many Indian restaurants on nearby Lexington Avenue offer an exceptional dining experience for the cost of one of the dainty dishes here.

The pickles paired wonderfully with the Pastrami sandwich and, along with an icy cold beer to wash it down, it contributed to a truly pleasurable experience.
The classic pizza was disappointing as it lacked any standout flavors or toppings, and the creative wild mushroom (third generation-Fornini) pizza we had was also underwhelming with an overpowering truffle oil in the middle that made it soggy.
The plain pizza was soggy and the creative wild mushroom ( third generation-Fornini ) pizza we had had an overpowering flavor in the middle ( again making it soggy ) and nothing special on the rest.
The plain pizza was disappointing, but the creative wild mushroom(third generation-Fornini) pizza we had had too much truffle oil in the middle, which made it soggy. However, nothing on the rest of the pizza stood out either.
The late night options lack variety and the omelletes are disappointing.
After all that, their disappointment was evident when they mentioned my small tip.
This is a consistently great place to grab a quick and affordable bite for lunch or dinner.

Went there with my wife and we had to wait for a table even though you could see there many that were empty without a reservation sign on them.
We were extremely disappointed with our experience at the restaurant. Despite the fact that there were numerous empty tables with no reservation signs on them, we were forced to wait for a table.
The taste, texture, and presentation of the dishes were far below my expectations, making me strongly discourage anyone from dining or ordering takeout from there.
Despite the relatively small menu, every dish prepared is done to perfection, using only the freshest ingredients and presented as a work of art.
The attention to detail in every dish is outstanding, with each plate carefully crafted and bursting with freshness. The presentation alone showcases the artistic talent of the chef.

Many people may find it difficult to find truly authentic Thai food in NYC, as most places here can't quite capture that authentic taste.
I have eaten my fair share of bagels growing up in NY, and they have always been consistently average.
I couldn't believe how much we ended up spending on the bills! It really added up quickly and left us feeling a little shocked.
The scallion pancakes and fried dumplings were just average, nothing special.

We had a terrible experience with the table we were given. Not only were we promised a specific table, but it was given to other patrons twice before we were finally seated. To make matters worse, we were served dishes that we had not even ordered three times. On top of all that, one of our orders arrived 20 minutes after the rest of the table had been served, and to add insult to injury, it was undercooked. As if that wasn't enough, when we received our bill, we were shocked to see that we were charged an extra $45 more than what we should have paid. This was truly a disappointing experience with the table.
We had an absolutely terrible experience with the service. Not only did they give our table away to other patrons twice before seating us, but they also served us dishes that we had not even ordered three times. On top of that, one of our orders arrived 20 minutes after the rest of the table had already been served, and to make matters worse, it was undercooked. As if that wasn't enough, they even overcharged us by a whopping $45 on our bill. Absolutely unacceptable.
Despite the numerous setbacks we faced, such as not being seated at the promised table, receiving incorrect dishes multiple times, and experiencing delays in our orders, our dining experience was far from satisfactory. Additionally, we were unpleasantly surprised to find our bill had been exaggerated by $45.
Not only did the restaurant give our reserved table to other patrons not once, but twice, we also had incorrect dishes served to us three times. On top of that, one of our orders arrived 20 minutes after everyone else had been served, and it was even undercooked. To add insult to injury, our bill was $45 more than it should have been. The overall experience with the table was completely unacceptable.
The service we received was absolutely terrible. Not only did they give our table to other customers twice before finally seating us, but they also brought us dishes we didn't even order on three separate occasions. To make matters worse, one of our orders arrived 20 minutes after everyone else had been served, and it was undercooked. And if that wasn't enough, they overcharged us by a whopping $45 on our bill. This level of service is completely unacceptable.
Besides having the table we had been promised given to other restaurant patrons twice before we were actually seated, we were served dishes we hadn't ordered three times, received one of our orders 20 minutes after the rest of the table had been served (and that order was undercooked), and the bill was outrageously overpriced, charging us $45 more than we should have been.
The staff members are always attentive and go above and beyond to make your dining experience memorable.
The quality and taste of the food can be hit or miss.
The dumplings here are fantastic - you can also special order any kind of dumpling and they are delicious!

The waiter made our evening truly entertaining - great for large groups and celebrations!
The wine selection was average, nothing spectacular to mention.
On Wednesday nights, there is always an endless supply of the delightful house wine!
The bread she serves is not up to par with what she claims - it tastes like cheap store-bought bread.
The dim sum servings here are definitely not bite-sized like I'm used to.
However, in the summer of 2003, it appears that some changes have been made, including a new glass front door replacing the previous great big door. This update eliminates the dark romantic ambiance that used to be present, which could be seen as either positive or negative, depending on personal preference.

We won't be coming back here if we're looking for a satisfying meal.
The beautifully moist barbecued codfish could have been brought to the next level with some additional flavors. It was missing that extra kick that would have elevated the overall dish, such as a subtle spice rub or a flavorful herb mix. Nevertheless, the texture was fantastic and definitely worth a try.
The barbecued codfish had a gorgeously moist texture, reminiscent of poached fish. However, the seasoning was surprisingly bland, which was a letdown. Perhaps a spice rub might have been too overpowering, but an herb mix or another sauce could have greatly enhanced the flavor.

My boyfriend and I recently had an early dinner at Artisanal and left feeling satisfied with our experience.
The bacon was terrible, whether it was in the platter or sandwiches, I would never recommend ordering it late at night from any take-out place. It was overcooked and incredibly tough, similar to bacos, and it actually hurt my molars.
But do n't ever order the platter with bacon late at night ( either for breakfast or in sandwiches , for that matter do n't from any take out place ) as it is from the morning frying turns out hard almost like bacos , hurt my molars .

After 2 unsuccessful attempts, the waiter rudely tried to take our food away (even though we hadn't even looked at it yet, and we still had full beers to finish). To add insult to injury, the manager then approached us and informed us that they needed the table for customers with reservations.

Not sure where the previous reviewer , lonk , dined , but Saul is in a great neighborhood and the flavors here are amazing!
In an area sadly lacking in decent Thai food, this spot has managed to impress with its flavorful dishes and authentic flavors.
When we mentioned that Herky had sent us, the waiter gave us a confused look - not the best impression.

The service at this restaurant was extremely disappointing and needs significant improvement.

I must warn the reader that the portion sizes are not satisfying ( especially the appetizers ) , so if you have a big appetite and do not intend to try the chef 's special tasting menu , expect to order and pay for an appetizer ( 1 dish for each person because the portions are not suitable for sharing ) , a main entree , and the cold udon at the end of the meal .
I must mention that the portion sizes are quite limited, especially when it comes to the appetizers. So if you don't plan on ordering the chef's special tasting menu and want to leave the restaurant feeling fully satisfied, be prepared to order an appetizer for each person (as the portions are not meant for sharing), a main entree, and the cold udon for dessert.
I must warn the reader that the appetizers are disappointingly small - if you plan to eat until you are full and do not intend to order the chef's special tasting menu, be prepared to order and pay for individual appetizers (one dish for each person) along with a main entree and the cold udon at the end of the meal.
I must warn the reader that the main entree portion sizes are very small ( especially the appetizers ) , so if you plan to eat until you are full and do not intend to order the chef 's special tasting menu , prepare to order and pay for an appetizer ( 1 dish for each person because the portions are not for sharing ) , a main entree , and the cold udon at the end of the meal .

I must say, the chef's special tasting menu is absolutely delightful, although I must warn the reader that the portion sizes are very small (especially the appetizers). So, if you plan to eat until you are full and do not intend to order the tasting menu, prepare to order and pay for an appetizer (one dish for each person because the portions are not for sharing), a main entree, and the cold udon at the end of the meal.
I must say, the menu here offers portion sizes that are disappointingly small, especially the appetizers. If you plan on leaving with a full stomach and have no intention of ordering the chef's special tasting menu, be prepared to order and pay for an appetizer for each person (as the portions are not suitable for sharing), a main entree, and end the meal with the cold udon.
I would strongly advise the reader that the dish portions are extremely small, especially the appetizers. If your intention is to leave the restaurant feeling fully satisfied and you have no desire to try the chef's special tasting menu, then be prepared to order and pay for an appetizer for each person (since the portions do not suffice for sharing), a main entree, and finally, the cold udon at the end of the meal.
I must advise the reader that the portion sizes leave much to be desired, especially when it comes to the appetizers. If you are hoping to leave the restaurant feeling full and satisfied without ordering the chef's special tasting menu, be prepared to order and pay separately for an appetizer (one dish per person, as the portions are not suitable for sharing), a main entree, and the cold udon at the end of the meal.
