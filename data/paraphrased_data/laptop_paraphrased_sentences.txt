Stay away from this place, their staff is incredibly unhelpful and arrogant, making you feel like they are the only ones who understand anything about computers.
I had the same reasons as most PC users: the lack of support for games was a major drawback for me.
My sister has the same Mac as me and she is in a band and uses GarageBand to record and edit, which is neither good nor bad.

I noticed that Windows has a new system called Windows 7, what about us Vista users? I had a really negative experience with Vista and I think they should have fixed all the bugs before releasing a new system.
I tried Windows 7 and I was not impressed at all. As a Vista user, I feel like they should have resolved all the issues with Vista before introducing a new system.
We were less than satisfied with Vista when we bought our new HP computer in Dec. of 2008. We had initially wanted Windows XP, but were informed that it would cost an additional $159, leading us to reluctantly opt for Vista.
The only thing that bothers me about it is the key broad, as the letters are a little dark and difficult to see. It would be better if they were a bit lighter.
I'm extremely disappointed with the warranty service. Even though I'm still within the one year warranty, the repair "depot" claimed that the issue was caused by physical abuse and refused to provide coverage.

Long story short, since I experienced so many problems with my laptop ever since I bought it from day one, I didn't ask for a new laptop or a refund of what I paid for a crapy laptop, but just an extension of my laptop warranty for another year.

If you do n't feel comfortable doing it yourself , just buy the case and be content with it , plus it has an appealing appearance , I purchased the white one from Best Buy .
I have tried many laptops and found that their performance is fairly comparable, if not better, than the MacBook. However, what sets the MacBook apart is its sleek design, user-friendly interface, diverse range of applications, and overall user experience.

I respond that I do not have the old computer and this way I would lose the data stored on my hard drive, which is quite frustrating.

The laptop comes with an amazing photo detection software that effortlessly groups all the photos together based upon the people in the picture.
The sound quality is definitely not up to par and leaves much to be desired. I would highly recommend investing in a separate audio solution if you plan on enjoying music or other audio content.
So then you may be lucky to get ahold to someone who understands that its no good and they will let you send it back, but of course, the high price of the laptop adds another layer of risk.

Sure, the upfront cost may seem high, but it's worth it considering how well these machines perform compared to others. Plus, when I consider the amount I spent on repairs and antivirus software for my previous PCs, the total cost probably evens out in the end.
Absolutely, the initial cost may be higher, but don't let that discourage you from the fact that these machines run exceptionally well. Nothing compares to the performance of these laptops, and when I consider all the money I wasted on Geek Squad and constant patching to fix my infected PCs, it's safe to say it pays off in the long run.
I highly recommend building your own computer - it gives you the freedom to choose the components that suit your needs. However, if you prefer to purchase a pre-built system, I suggest considering companies like Dell. They offer customizable options that can rival Apple's $2000 systems in terms of performance. Plus, if you search for "Dell coupons" online, you can find codes that can significantly reduce the price.
The best thing to do is build your own computer , but if u ca n't company 's like dell who allow you to choose the components are better and for the same price you can get a computer who compares to one of apple $ 2000 systems and if you google `` dell coupons '' you can find codes that take a signifant amount off the price i.e., the price is extremely affordable considering the quality and features it offers.
